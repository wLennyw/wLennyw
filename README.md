## Hi, I'm Lenny! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ’¬ I majored in Internet Technology and started my career as a trainer and programmer. Later, I pivoted into marketing and pursued a Diploma in APAC Marketing at NUS Extension to deepen my understanding, which led to a role in digital marketing.

That role brought me closer to data, from budgeting and tracking to measuring and optimizing performance daily. It naturally transitioned into a data analyst position, where I expanded beyond marketing to cover business-wide data, including finance, logistics, and product optimization.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently deepening my skills in statistics, advanced Python, and AI through [365 Data Science](https://learn.365datascience.com/) to become a more effective analyst and deliver greater data-driven value. Iâ€™m also building my personal portfolio along the way.

âœ¨ Outside of work, I enjoy exercising, traveling, and Iâ€™m currently working on improving my chess game.
